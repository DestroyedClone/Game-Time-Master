# Game Time Master
Sick of memorising time zones to convert for games and their daily reset times?  
Then this is for you!

- Automatically detects your local time zone.
- Converts all game server times to your local time zone.
- Show the time remaining until a game server's daily reset.
- Automatically refreshes data every minute.

Feel free to request for more games to be added by creating an issue [here](https://github.com/cicerakes/Game-Time-Master/issues).

## Feature roadmap
- Search function.
- Filter specific games and save this setting per browser.
- Add an option to refresh and display every second.
- Add an option to switch between 12 and 24 hour time formats.
